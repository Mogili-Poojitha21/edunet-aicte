# SECURE DATA HIDING IN IMAGES USING STEGANOGRAPHY

## Introduction
Steganography is the art of concealing secret information within an image, making it undetectable to the human eye. This project implements a secure data hiding mechanism using image-based steganography techniques.

## Features
- Securely hide and retrieve text data within images.
- Supports multiple image formats.
- Ensures high security and minimal image distortion.
- Simple and efficient implementation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/techtrainer20/Stenography.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Stenography
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

## Usage
The script provides options for encoding and decoding hidden messages in images.

### Steps to Hide a Message:
1. Run the script.
2. Select an image and input the secret message.
3. The encoded image will be generated and saved.

### Steps to Retrieve a Message:
1. Run the script.
2. Select the encoded image.
3. The hidden message will be extracted and displayed.
